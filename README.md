Things I enjoyed about this assigmnent:
- trying out the new decorators feature in TypeScript
- using a `QueryBuilder` to write optimized SQL statements
- indexing the data in a paginated manner
- organizing the data in an apprioprate relational format
- separation of concerns (JSON <=> DTO <=> Entity <=> DTO <=> JSON)

Things I struggled with:
- inserting and connecting relations between entities
- testing (they still don't work properly, but manual testing proves otherwise)
- doing more intensive debugging than `console.log`
